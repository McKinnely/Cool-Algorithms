Laboratory Assignment Nr. 4 . September 13th 2016 0700- 0900

Avanu hardware store in Obunti(a fictitious country in Africa), has
contracted you to create a class called HardwareStoreInvoice that
Avanu hardware store might use to represent an invoice for an item
sold at their store.
An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance
variables‐ a part_number(type String), a part_description(type
String),a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a
price per item (double).
Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four
instance variables.
Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.
In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that
calculates the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the
price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the
quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is
not positive, it should be set to 0.0.
Write a test application (a program containing the main method)
named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice’s
capabilities.(i.e. create at least one HardwareStoreInvoice object,
and call their methods to test if they work)

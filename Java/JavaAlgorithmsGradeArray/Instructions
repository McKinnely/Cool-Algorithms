Method GetName: returns student Name.
Method GetFaculty: returns student Faculty.
Method Display: displays/prints all attributes of a students if it receives the value 0 else it only prints student ID and Name.

Names = {“Moeng”, “Moesi”, “Mogapi”, “Selepe”, “Neo”, “Kgwetlho”, “Tshepho”, “Marothedi”}
IDs = {100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800}
Perform the following
Display all students.
Display all students in the Faculty of Science.
Search for a student with ID=500 and change their name to “Kagiso”
Search for a student named “Neo” and change their ID to 900.
Display all students.
